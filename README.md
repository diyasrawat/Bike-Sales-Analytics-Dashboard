# Bike-Sales-Analytics-Dashboard

# Project Overview
This interactive Microsoft Excel dashboard provides insights into customer behaviors, preferences, and trends to help guide data-driven product and marketing decisions.

The dashboard enables users to:

1. Explore the underlying dataset of bike buyer information through intuitive filters in Excel
2. Visualize key performance metrics for different customer segments using Excel charts
3. Analyze the popularity of bike models across age groups, regions etc using Excel pivot tables
4. Spot changes over time in purchasing patterns via Excel graphs and conditional formatting
5. Identify behavioral differences across demographics using stacked columns and more
6. This addresses the need for actionable bike buyer analytics direct in Excel, allowing decisions makers to conduct segmentation and analysis dynamically. Rather than relying on intuition or static reports, interactive dashboards empower self-service investigation.

By surfacing hidden insights, both strategic and tactical business decisions can be optimized based on statistically significant trends. This is facilitated through Excel's powerful visualization, pivot table, and filter capabilities.

# Steps to Create Dashboard

# Concepts Used
1. Descriptive Analytics
The dashboard utilizes descriptive analytics techniques like measures of central tendency, dispersion, distributions to summarize patterns in dimensions like customer age, income, and purchase frequency. Helps surface overall trends.

2. Data Visualization Principles
Charts and graphs like bar plots, histograms, scatter plots have been thoughtfully selected and designed based on data visualization best practices to transform bike buyer data into intuitive insights.

3. Interactive Data Exploration
Excel interactivity features enable end-users to dynamically filter, segment, and explore data on the fly without dependency on static reports. Empowers self-service investigation.

4. Aggregation and PivotTables
Aggregating metrics and pivoting transactional data faciliates analysis across multiple dimensions to uncover insights by age group, location, income bracket, and more bike buyer attributes.

5. Correlation Analysis
Statistical techniques help quantify and visualize the strength of relationships between dimensions like product preferences and demographics, purchase history and lifecycle stage.
